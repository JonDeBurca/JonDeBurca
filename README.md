Hi, Iâ€™m Jon.  I am a full time claims processor for a health insureance company and a part time data enthusiast. 
I am final year student studying Data Science and Analytics at MTU.  I am working on my final thesis: "A study of the statistics used to measure mortality rates in a population". 
I have experience using Python, R, SQL and Tableau.  I am open to new opportunities, particularily in the area of data analytics
